1.Problem Statement:
Indian students living in the UK face challenges in finding affordable groceries and familiar Indian products across multiple stores. They lack a centralized platform to compare prices and availability of Indian grocery items, leading to time-consuming searches and potentially higher expenses. Our web app aims to solve this issue by providing a comprehensive price comparison tool for Indian groceries across various UK supermarkets and specialty stores, helping students save money and easily find the products they need.
Key aspects of the problem:
1.	Difficulty in locating Indian groceries: Many Indian students struggle to find specific Indian brands and products needed for cooking traditional dishes or snacks in the UK.
2.	Price variations: Grocery prices can vary significantly between different stores, making it challenging for budget-conscious students to find the best deals.
3.	Time-consuming process: Without a centralized comparison tool, students must manually check multiple stores or websites to find the best prices, which is inefficient.
4.	Limited knowledge of local options: New students may be unfamiliar with UK supermarkets and specialty stores that offer Indian groceries.
5.	Budget constraints: As students often have limited financial resources, finding affordable groceries is crucial for managing their expenses.
By addressing these issues, your grocery web app can provide significant value to Indian students in the UK, helping them save money, time, and effort in their grocery shopping experience.

•	Provide a comprehensive comparison of grocery prices across multiple stores.
